Deepface is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis (age, gender, emotion and race) framework for python. It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping state-of-the-art models: VGG-Face, Google FaceNet, OpenFace, Facebook DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace and Dlib. Those models already reached and passed the human level accuracy. The library is mainly based on Keras and TensorFlow. (source: https://github.com/serengil/deepface)
